 *
 *	ue_crypt - in place encryption/decryption of a buffer
 *
 *	(C) Copyright 1986, Dana L. Hoggatt
 *	1216, Beck Lane, Lafayette, IN
 *
 *	When consulting directly with the author of this routine,
 *	please refer to this routine as the "DLH-POLY-86-B CIPHER".
 *
 *	This routine was written for Dan Lawrence, for use in V3.8 of
 *	MicroEMACS, a public domain text/program editor.
 *
 *	I kept the following goals in mind when preparing this function:
 *
 *	    1.	All printable characters were to be encrypted back
 *		into the printable range, control characters and
 *		high-bit characters were to remain unaffected.  this
 *		way, encrypted would still be just as cheap to
 *		transmit down a 7-bit data path as they were before.
 *
 *	    2.	The encryption had to be portable.  The encrypted
 *		file from one computer should be able to be decrypted
 *		on another computer.
 *
 *	    3.	The encryption had to be inexpensive, both in terms
 *		of speed and space.
 *
 *	    4.	The system needed to be secure against all but the
 *		most determined of attackers.
 *
 *	For encryption of a block of data, one calls crypt passing
 *	a pointer to the data block and its length. The data block is
 *	encrypted in place, that is, the encrypted output overwrites
 *	the input.  Decryption is totally isomorphic, and is performed
 *	in the same manner by the same routine.
 *
 *	Before using this routine for encrypting data, you are expected
 *	to specify an encryption key.  This key is an arbitrary string,
 *	to be supplied by the user.  To set the key takes two calls to
 *	ue_crypt().  First, you call
 *
 *		ue_crypt(NULL, vector)
 *
 *	This resets all internal control information.  Typically (and
 *	specifically in the case on MICRO-emacs) you would use a "vector"
 *	of 0.  Other values can be used to customize your editor to be
 *	"incompatible" with the normally distributed version.  For
 *	this purpose, the best results will be obtained by avoiding
 *	multiples of 95.
 *
 *	Then, you "encrypt" your password by calling
 *
 *		ue_crypt(pass, strlen(pass))
 *
 *	where "pass" is your password string.  Crypt() will destroy
 *	the original copy of the password (it becomes encrypted),
 *	which is good.  You do not want someone on a multiuser system
 *	to peruse your memory space and bump into your password.
 *	Still, it is a better idea to erase the password buffer to
 *	defeat memory perusal by a more technical snooper.
 *
 *	For the interest of cryptologists, at the heart of this
 *	function is a Beaufort Cipher.  The cipher alphabet is the
 *	range of printable characters (' ' to '~'), all "control"
 *	and "high-bit" characters are left unaltered.
 *
 *	The key is a variant autokey, derived from a weighted sum
 *	of all the previous clear text and cipher text.  A counter
 *	is used as salt to obliterate any simple cyclic behavior
 *	from the clear text, and key feedback is used to assure
 *	that the entire message is based on the original key,
 *	preventing attacks on the last part of the message as if
 *	it were a pure autokey system.
 *
 *	Overall security of encrypted data depends upon three
 *	factors:  the fundamental cryptographic system must be
 *	difficult to compromise; exhaustive searching of the key
 *	space must be computationally expensive; keys and plaintext
 *	must remain out of sight.  This system satisfies this set
 *	of conditions to within the degree desired for MicroEMACS.
 *
 *	Though direct methods of attack (against systems such as
 *	this) do exist, they are not well known and will consume
 *	considerable amounts of computing time.  An exhaustive
 *	search requires over a billion investigations, on average.
 *
 *	The choice, entry, storage, manipulation, alteration,
 *	protection and security of the keys themselves are the
 *	responsibility of the user.
