Vile supports the use of Perl as an extension language by embedding a
Perl interpreter into the editor.
<p>
The "--with-perl" configure option enables Perl support at build time on
Unix hosts (for Win32 instructions see the file README.PC).
<p>
After the executable is successfully built, up to date documentation for
the API in various formats may be obtained from the following make
targets (not built by default):
<pre>
    vile-perl-api.doc   (unix and win32)
    vile-perl-api.man   (unix hosts only)
    vile-perl-api.html  (unix hosts only)
</pre><p>
A recent version of Perl is required.  The interface was developed and
tested using 5.004_04.  The most recent version of Perl may be retrieved
from the URL:
<pre>
    <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/latest.tar.gz</a>
</pre><p>
The Perl interpreter requires subsidiary files, the location of which is
coded into the Perl library.  As such, if a Perl-enabled Vile binary is
to be installed onto multiple machines, the same version of Perl must be
installed on each target machine, in the same location.
<p>
This also means that if a newer version of Perl is installed, Vile must
either be rebuilt against the new version, or the version-specific
directory (given by "perl -V:archlib") of the old version must be
retained.
<p>
Note also that embedding a Perl interpreter into Vile will increase the
size of the binary.  On many platforms, a shared Perl library may be
built which, at the cost of a load-time performance penalty, can
substantially reduce the size of the compiled vile, xvile, [nvi, apache,
etc, ...] and of course perl binaries.
<p>
See also the output of "perl -V:useshrplib" and the section "Building a
shared libperl.so Perl library" in the "INSTALL" file from the Perl
distribution.

The Perl interface for vile was originally written
by Kevin Buettner in 1997 and 1998.
