This Perl extension to vile gives you the ability to send edit
requests to a running Vile (sort of like gnuserv does
for Emacs).  Vile is lightweight enough to run several
at a time, but when using a file manager (like TkDesk)
it is convenient to click on files and "add" them to a
current Vile session.
<p>
Attached are two files, Vileserv.pm and vileget.  Vileserv.pm
is for loading into a perl-enabled Vile session, and vileget
is a utility for sending requests to the editor.  You can
use pod2man to get the man pages:
<pre>
	pod2man Vileserv.pm > vileserv.man
	pod2man vileget > vileget.man
</pre>

Vileserv was written by J Chris Coppick in 1998.
